# EventExtractionB
The code extracts sports events from a news article using NLTK's named entity recognition (NER) and part of speech tagging (POS) techniques. It tokenizes the text into sentences, removes stop words, lemmatizes words, performs POS tagging, and then extracts named entities using the ne_chunk function.
